# Class Graph
#
# The graph class takes a string. The string contains the representation
# of a Dungeon, in which we want to travel from the position A to the position
# B. It must be possible to convert the string in a square matrix, thus
# the end of each line of the string must contain no additional chars 
# with respect to others.
#
# The initialization takes some  arguments to understand wich are the 
# chars used to represents the different parts of the dungeon. For 
# defaults:
#
#  - Start point: "A"
#  - Stop point: "B"
#  - Obstacles: "#"
#  - Empty spaces: " "
#  - Out path: "*"
#
# The class needs the existance of another class, that is called Node. This
# class, for this repository, is described in the file node.rb. The object
# created is a connected graph of nodes, that is not explored, in which we
# have only the connectivity between nodes. For example:
#
#        5     6     7
#    7  " " | " " | "#" 
#      ----+-----+----
#    8  " " | "A" | "#"     Node (A) in (8,6) --+---> Node in (7, 6)
#      ----+-----+----                          |
#    9  "#" | "#" | "#"                         +---> Node in (8, 5)
#
# given this situation (the numbers represents the number of row and the number
# of column), the starting node is in (8, 6), and the Graph class will creates
# the connections between the free nodes in (7, 6) and (8, 5). The nodes in 
# (8, 7) and (9, 6) cannot be reached because of the obstacles.
#
# The connections are only with the adjacent classes in the four directions
# up, down, left, right. Tere are no diagonal connections, even if they can
# be easily created.
# 
# The class exposes only two attributes:
#  
#  - start: is a Node, and it is the starting node
#  - stop: is a Node and it is the stopping node
#
# NOTA BENE: Prima di poter utilizzare questa classe si deve definire
#            la classe Node, che rappresenta il nodo del grafo.
#            Useremo questo script nella lezione del 12 Maggio.
